# Project Codewars - 7 kyu in SQL

## Story

It cannot be stressed enough that you can learn to code only through practice.
There are numerous coding sites, but [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) is one
of the best because it's huge community, good assignment descriptions and
gamified progress support.

In this project we ask you to practice your SQL skills on Codewars and
get better!

## What are you going to learn?

You will learn and practice how to write basic queries in SQL:
- compose `SELECT` statements with filtering and ordering
- use some basic operators and functions (e.g. `IN`, `NOT IN`, `MIN`,
  `MAX`, `SUM`, `%`, `SQRT`, `LOG`, `FLOOR`, `CEIL`, `LOWER`)

## Tasks


1. Reach 7 kyu in SQL on the Codewars coding platform by solving katas.

    - There is a screenshot of the student's Codewars profile page (`https://www.codewars.com/users/<username>`) named `screenshot.jpg` pushed into the repository which shows that the student has reached _at least the required level in the required language_


## General requirements


 - The student has an account on the [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) coding platform

## Hints

- Try to solve 8 kyu katas first. You can see all of them [here]
(https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/sql?q=&r%5B%5D=-8&tags=Databases).
- You can train yourself by random katas by using the `Your next challange...`
box on your [dashboard](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard). If you want to try
harder katas, choose `Rank Up`, if you want to solidify your knowledge at a given
level, choose `Practice and Repeat` from the dropdown.
